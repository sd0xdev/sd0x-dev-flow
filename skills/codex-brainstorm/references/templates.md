## Claude Independent Analysis

### Problem Essence

#### Surface Requirement

User wants [X]

#### 5 Whys

1. Why: Why do we need [X]? → Because [Y]
2. Why: Why is [Y] important? → Because [Z]
3. Why: Why is [Z] a problem? → Because [...]
4. Why: ...
5. Why: ...

#### Core Problem

The real problem to solve is [core problem]

### Constraint Inventory

| Type     | Constraint | Flexibility  | If broken...       |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------ | ------------------ |
| Technical | ...       | None/Low/Med | What happens?      |
| Business | ...        | ...          | ...                |
| Resource | ...        | ...          | ...                |

### Claude's Optimal Hypothesis

**Proposal: [specific proposal]**

Rationale:

1. [Why this is optimal]
2. [...]

Self-critique (potential weaknesses):

1. [Weakness 1]
2. [Weakness 2]

### Prepare for Debate

Anticipated proposals from Codex:

1. [Proposal A] → My attack point: [...]
2. [Proposal B] → My attack point: [...]
```

## Phase 3: Debate Record

```markdown
## Debate Record

### Round N

**Codex Position**: [Proposal Y]

- Rationale: [...]
- Self-identified weaknesses: [...]

**Claude Attack**:

1. [Attack point 1]
2. [Attack point 2]

**Codex Rebuttal**:

1. [Rebuttal 1]
2. [Rebuttal 2]

**Claude Response**:

- Regarding Rebuttal 1: [Agree/Disagree] + [Reason]
- Regarding Rebuttal 2: [Agree/Disagree] + [Reason]

**Position Update**:

- Claude: [Maintain/Update to Z]
- Codex: [Maintain/Update to W]

**Equilibrium Check**:

- Can Claude raise new attacks? [Yes/No]
- Can Codex raise new attacks? [Yes/No]
```

## Phase 5: Final Report

# Nash Equilibrium Report: [Topic]

## Executive Summary

| Item              | Value                                  |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Equilibrium Type  | Pure Strategy / Conditional / Pareto / None |
| Debate Rounds     | N                                      |
| Final Proposal    | [X]                                    |
| Confidence        | High (both agree) / Medium / Low       |

## Equilibrium Solution

**Proposal: [X]**

[Proposal description]

### Why This Is the Optimal Solution

| Dimension            | Rating | Consensus |
| -------------------- | ------ | --------- |
| Technical Feasibility | G     | Y         |
| Effort               | Y     | Y         |
| Risk                 | G     | Y         |
| Scalability          | G     | Y         |

### Rejected Proposals

| Proposal | Proposer | Rejection Reason | Rejected In |
| -------- | -------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| [A]      | Claude   | [Fatal flaw]     | R2          |
| [B]      | Codex    | [Fatal flaw]     | R3          |

## Debate Summary

### Key Turning Points

1. **R2**: Claude accepted Codex's criticism of [X], abandoned [A]
2. **R4**: Codex acknowledged [constraint] is unavoidable, updated position
3. **R5**: Both converged to [X]

### Most Valuable Arguments

| Source | Argument   | Impact                       |
| ------ | ---------- | ---------------------------- |
| Claude | [argument] | Led Codex to abandon [B]     |
| Codex  | [argument] | Led Claude to update to [X]  |

## Implementation Recommendations

1. [Specific step 1]
2. [Specific step 2]
3. [Specific step 3]

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk     | Probability  | Mitigation   |
| -------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| [Risk 1] | Low/Med/High | [Mitigation] |
